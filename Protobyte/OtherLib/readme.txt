Welcome to the OSC Library!

The OSC Library is a toolkit for programmers creating sound related software for the Windows platform. OSC is an acronym for Open Sound Code. The term 'Open' refers to the fact that the source code for the whole library is publicly available. The main purpose of this library is to take away some of the tedious work required to implement sound related software. It is my hope that this will inspire programmers to create more cool software. It is also my hope that people start contributing to the OSC Library so that it can grow and become even more usefull.

The OSC Library is available for free to developers of free software under the terms described in the file doc\osc_licenses.html.

The OSC Library is created and maintained by Thomas Hammer (thammer@pvv.org) and it's home is at the HammerSound website (http://listen.to/HammerSound/).
