<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">OSC Library Licenses</font></h1>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The OSC Library is licensed under three different licenses. </font></small>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#The OSC Public License"><small><font face="Arial">The OSC Public License</font></small></a></li>
  <li><a href="#The OSC Contributors License"><small><font face="Arial">The OSC Contributors
    License</font></small></a></li>
  <li><a href="#The OSC Commercial License"><small><font face="Arial">The OSC Commercial
    License</font></small></a></li>
</ul>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The OSC Library is considered to be everything included in
the download package (including examples and documentation). The License applies to the
use of source code as well as to the use of any libraries, static or dynamically linked
(included com and/or ActiveX components in any form) based on the OSC Library.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Make sure you read all licenses thoroughly to find which
license is appropriate for you. </font></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="The OSC Public License">The OSC Public License</a></font></h2>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The&nbsp; OSC Public License equals the Q Public License
version 1.0 with a few additional terms listed <a href="#Additional terms">below</a>. This
is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source</a> license which
basically states that if you are developing free software with public source code, you can
use the OSC Library for free. If this description fits and you want to use the OSC
Library, please read the whole <a href="http://www.troll.no/qpl/" target="_top">Q Public
License</a> for a list of your rights and your obligations. </font></small></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">The OSC Public License - <a name="Additional terms">Additional
terms</a> </font></h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">When you release a version of your software to the public, you
    must notify the <a href="mailto:thammer@pvv.org">OSC Library Manager</a> so he can list
    your software on the HammerSound/OSC website.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">Your software must display in a easily visible place (such as
    an about box, a splash screen or similar) that it uses source code from the OpenSoundCode
    Library at HammerSound together with the url <a href="http://listen.to/HammerSound/">http://listen.to/HammerSound/</a></font></small></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="The OSC Contributors License"><font face="Arial">The OSC Contributors License</font></a></h2>

<p><small><font face="Arial">For some people, the OSC Public License's requirement of
public source code is too strict. Releasing free software is fine, but they would rather
not release (all) the source code.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Since we in no way want to discourage people from using OSC,
or (God forbid) from releasing free software, we created the OSC Contributors License. The
OSC Contributors License equals the OSC Public License with one modification: If you are a
OSC contributor, you can release software using the OSC Library without releasing the
source code to your software, as long as your software is free. You still have to release
the source code to any direct modifications you make to the OSC Library code, and this
sorce code is subject to the OSC Public License.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">In other words, if you want to release a free program using
OSC without releasing the source code, you'll have to contribute in some way to the OSC
Library. A contribution would normally be a donation of source code. If you'd like to
qualify to the OSC Contributors License, please contact the <a href="mailto:thammer@pvv.org">OSC Library Manager</a>.</font></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="The OSC Commercial License">The OSC Commercial License</a></font></h2>

<p><small><font face="Arial">If you are not giving away your program for free, but rather
choose to charge some money for it, this license is for you. We feel that if you make
money on a piece of software that uses the OSC Library, those who have created the Library
deserve their share.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">We haven't really worked out a general commercial license
yet, so if you want one, you have to reach an agreement with the <a href="mailto:thammer@pvv.org">OSC Library Manager</a>. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">The two alternatives are basically: </font></small>

<ul>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">An up-front one-time payment for using the OSC Library, and no
    royalties. </font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">Royalties, in the area of 5-10 % of the price of the software,
    no up-front (usefull for shareware / low-income projects)</font></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Paid support for the OSC Library is also available.</font></small></p>
