<p><img src="images/sfx06b_screenshot.gif" alt="sfx06b_screenshot.gif (7756 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="379"><small><font face="Arial">SFExplorer is a windows application for users of
SoundFont compatible devices (such as SBLive, AWE32, etc.). </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">SFExplorer lets the user browse and preview (using MIDI) the
SoundFonts currently loaded by the SoundFont compatible device, as well as load new
SoundFonts and delete SoundFonts from memory. SFExplorer can also be set up as the default
viewer for SoundFont files (*.sf2) for one-click preview.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Version 0.6 (beta) adds the possibility to browse directories
on disk or CDs. This feature is great for quick access to all your SoundFonts, and for
browsing SoundFont CDs</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Version 0.6 (beta) is fully functionable, but lacks a lot of
features and may have some errors. The main purpose of releasing it before it is finished
is to get feedback from users. So please <a href="mailto:thammer@pvv.org">mail me</a> and
tell me about your experiences (good or bad) with this program.</font></small></p>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Installation</strong></font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Download and install Creative Labs' SoundFont Management
System if you don't have it allready. </font></small>

<ol>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">Download and unzipl SFExplorer v0.5 (beta). </font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">Run Setup.exe. </font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Arial">Download SFExplorer v0.6 (beta) and copy the executable
    (SFExplorer.exe) to the directory where you installed SFExplorer v0.5 beta (replacing the
    older version).</font></small></li>
</ol>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Alternatively (if you have problems getting the installer to
work), you can download just SFExplorer v0.6 beta and SFExplorer Extras. Copy the
executable to a directory of your choice and try to run it. If it complains about missing
or too old files, copy files from SFExplorer Extras to your \Windows\System directory.</font></small></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial">Documentation</font></strong></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Sorry, but you're pretty much on your own. The up-side is
that the program is really not very complicated. Just remember to try the right mouse
button.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">If you should suddenly get problems starting SFExplorer (for
instance after installing new soundcards, MIDI devices, etc), try deleting the file
sfx.ini.</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Please report successes and failures to <a href="mailto:thammer@pvv.org">thammer@pvv.org</a>.</font></small></p>
